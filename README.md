# Project.3
USA Housing Listing Rentals

Proposal
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in the 12 of the top largest cities by population to uncover correlations between rental prices to income. Weâ€™ll examine relationships > between city population and income capita, income capita to rental prices, rental prices to city population > over a snapshot of the year 2020.

Hypothesis:
-	Between city population and income capita -> Larger the city, income capita will be more.
-	Income capita to rental prices -> If the income of the population is high, then the rental prices will also be higher. 
-	Rental prices to city population -> Rental prices will be the highest in the cities with the highest population.

Resources:

1.	Census_data.csv
2.	Final_data.csv
